<!-- Intro: short hook about the overall tone -->
We all practice the suspension of disbelief needed to enjoy science‑fiction stories, and many of us grew up with Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, more recently The Mandalorian, and countless others.

I wanted to write something a little different.

More hard sci‑fi, more realistic – even outside the starships.

And I hope I managed to do that, and that you’ll appreciate the difference.

<!-- What you WON’T find -->
In this series you won’t find OP protagonists, nor harems of green, lithe, obliging alien girls.

No supermen or superwomen; well, someone with exceptional traits does exist, but I won’t say more so as not to spoil the surprises.

No admirals who, while their ship is pulling 500 g, calmly give orders with a coffee in hand; no artificial gravity, no hand‑wavy shields.

<!-- What you WILL find -->
You will find people.

People who fight, others who despair, others caught in the middle of events much bigger than they are, others who love.

In short, you will find life in the age of the Kilrathi – even if these are not the same ones from Wing Commander.

<!-- Closing: why this might interest the reader -->
So who is this series for?

The main characters are often very young, at that point in life when emotions are at their most intense.

But it is not only a story for young readers: it deals with responsibility, compromise, politics, and long‑term consequences. If you’re interested in science fiction that tries to respect physics, that does not offer easy answers, and that uses starships and aliens to talk about people, then this series is meant for you.
