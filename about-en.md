![Ferdinando Simonetti](/images/author.jpg)

Ferdinando Simonetti is an Italian author making his literary debut with the
*From a Faraway Star* series. Born and raised in the picturesque region of
Liguria, Italy, he has always been captivated by storytelling.

A graduate of Classical High School and a Mechanical Engineer by training,
Ferdinando’s professional journey led him into the world of IT, where he works
in systems and cloud engineering.

Despite his technical career, he has always been passionate about literature.
A lifelong reader with a deep love for fantasy, science fiction, and historical
fiction, he finds inspiration in the works of authors such as Harry Turtledove,
Lois McMaster Bujold, and Martha Wells.

This passion for great stories has driven him to challenge himself in a new way:
by becoming a writer. With *From a Faraway Star*, he takes his first steps into
the world of fiction, crafting tales that blend imaginative storytelling with
his technical expertise.

Ferdinando lives in Genoa, in the heart of Liguria, where he enjoys reading,
writing, practicing *iaido* and *kendo* and exploring new worlds through both books and his own imagination.
