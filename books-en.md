## From a Faraway Star

![From a Faraway Star cover](/images/cover1.jpg)

When a giant colony ship along with its escorts emerges from deep space in 1866, the world changes overnight.
The Kilrathi—lion-like settlers from Kilrath Prime—came looking for a new beginning, not expecting to find railroads, armies, or the bustling frontier of post–Civil War America.
Thrown together by chance and necessity, humans and Kilrathi must navigate suspicion, opportunity, and the messy business of coexistence.

## Shar-3

![Shar-3 cover](/images/cover2.jpg)

Shar-3 is not the story of a first encounter, but of everything that follows it.
This book unfolds in the aftermath of contact, where coexistence has become routine and therefore political.
This is a story about integration that is never complete, authority that is never absolute, and progress that always carries a shadow. It does not offer simple answers or clean moral victories. Instead, it observes how civilizations test one another—not always with weapons, but with laws, customs, economies, and silence.
